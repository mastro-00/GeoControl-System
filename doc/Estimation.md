# Estimation approach

Consider the GeoControl project as described in the swagger, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch

# Estimate by size

| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  ~2 weeks |

Assuming a team of four people working 8 hours a day, five days a week, this work schedule can be represented in a Gantt chart.

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|                                    | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- | :--------------: | :----------------: |
| Estimate by Size                   |    300 hours     |      ~ 2 weeks     |
| Estimate by Product Decomposition  |    240 hours     |      1.5 weeks     |
| Estimate by Activity Decomposition |    410 hours     |      ~ 3 weeks     |

The *size-based estimate* is quick but less precise, focusing on the overall code size.

The *product decomposition estimate* balances detail with effort, assuming well-defined components.

The *activity decomposition estimate* is the most comprehensive but may overestimate non-coding tasks, leading to a longer timeline.
